# prestige unique value store

**Why the name 'prestige'?

In the movie, The Prestige, Hugh Jackman's character deduplicates himself after every time he performs his version of the Transported Man trick (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rfmHhWYKslU).  The prestige unique value store is a less gruesome, but no less effective way to deduplicate your data and maintain a queryable store with a single copy of your data.
